//Split a string without using split function
//Loops (Not Done)
// -> Print fibonacci series (0 1 1 2 3 5 8)
// -> Binary search
// -> Find the length of string without using any function
// -> Given array nums containing n numbers of distinct values in the range [0, n], return the only value that is missing from the array
// -> Write a program that returns true if the string contains the same frequency in for every character. Otherwise, return false

// const input = [1,2,3,4], Output = [24, 12, 8, 6]
// Given one string and one character, find the first occurence of the same character excluding spaces and if no occurence found return -1
// Ex: my name is amit, a -> output - 5
// Find capital letters in a string & return its index number
// Add search and find the name and list should filter accordingly (Carrier)

// Reduce, make function of reduce if JS doesn't have reduce (thinkSys)
// Get substr from this str without repeated characters
// const str = "geeksforgeeks", let str = '1245678989435' //456789
// Count triplets [1, 5, 3, 2] from this array
// Find subset from this array [1, 2, 3, 4]
// Result should be hisT is eghaM (capital letter should be moved to end of that word), const word = "This is Megha";
// Average of 5 no is 25 what is avearge of 3 no
